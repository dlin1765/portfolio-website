# How I made it

The website is built using React, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. I wanted to get more experience building reusable components since I knew I would have to update the site in the future.

# Challenges in developing this project

I wanted to use different techniques in HTML and CSS, learning how Grid layout worked was a bit strange in the beginning but I picked up pretty quickly. Ensuring that none of the text wrapped or clipped into images was much more in depth than my previous project so that was also a slight challenge. I learned by organizing CSS classes well and staying organized really helped me write media queries faster. 

# What I learned

This project taught me a lot about managing my projects directory, controlling state in React, and building layouts in HTML and CSS.
